Arduino DHT22 Temperature and Humidity Monitor with LCD

This project demonstrates how to use the DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor with an I2C 16x2 LCD display using Arduino. The sensor readings are displayed in real-time on the LCD, along with serial output for debugging.

Project Overview:

✅ Measures Temperature (°C) and Humidity (%) using DHT22.
✅ Displays real-time data on 16x2 LCD (I2C).
✅ Serial monitor output for logging sensor data.
✅ Error handling for failed sensor readings.
